        "description": "Russia's occupation of Ukrainian territories, particularly Donbas, allows access to vital resources like lithium, coal, and gas. Donbas is crucial as it holds 67% of Ukraine's coal reserves. The Ukrainian coal industry has significantly declined, from 180 million tons in 1989 to 29 million tons in 2021. Losing Donbas not only impacts Ukraine's economy but also its national identity, while Russia secures valuable mineral resources, including significant lithium reserves for electric vehicle batteries.",
